# Question #2: Array Deduping

Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

## Example

Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

## PSEUDOCODE

without Array.filter()

- input comes in, toBeFiltered
- use Set to save only one copy of each

with Array.filter()

- input array is named toBeFiltered
- array comes in, toBeFiltered.filter from the array
