Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

// loop through each character.
// consider the character at current index. See if the remaining string "includes" this character
// if it does, return false;
// if not, keep searching
